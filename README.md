Devtest Readme
Hello candidate, Welcome to our little dev test. The goal of this exercise, is to asses your general skill level, and give us something to talk about at our next appointment.

What this app should do
SlapSticker is an app that lets users to slap stickers on their face, using their webcam. Functionality wise the app works, but the ui needs some love. We'd like for you to extend this prototype to make it look and feel it bit better.

These are the basic requirements:
User can pick a sticker
User can give the captured image a title
User can place the sticker over the webcam image
User can capture the webcam image with sticker
##What we want you to do

Off course we didn't expect you to build a full fledged app in such a short time frame. That's why the basic requirements are already implemented.

However, we would like for you to show off your strengths as a developer by improving the app.

Some ideas (no need to do all):
Make it look really nice
Let users pick from multiple (custom) stickers
Improve the workflow and ux
Show multiple captured images in a gallery
Let users download or share the captured pics
Add super cool effects to webcam feed
Organize, document and test the code
Integrate with zoom, teams, meet...
quickstart
You can clone this repo to get started
run $ npm install to install deps
run $ npm run start to start dev environment
push it to github or gitlab to share it with us.
P.s. We've already added some libraries to make your life easier (Create React App, Jss, React Router), but feel free to add more.

Original Create React App
Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
